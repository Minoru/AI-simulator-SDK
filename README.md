This is a software development kit (SDK) for [AI-simulator project] [1]. It
provides `NetworkingManager` class that takes care of sending and receiving
network messages.

You can find example bot that uses that SDK under `example/robot`, and example
environment controller under `example/environment`

`environment-profile-generator` directory contains small GUI utility that
enables you to generate environment profile (see [AI-simulator wiki page on
environment configuration
file](https://github.com/SmirnoffYM/AI-simulator/wiki/Environment-configuration-file)
for details).
